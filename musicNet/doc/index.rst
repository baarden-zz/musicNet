musicNet
====================================

The musicNet module is a system for conducting complex searches of symbolic polyphonic music databases. Searches are constructed by buildings networks of relationships and can be multidimensional, searching for patterns in multiple voices and other musical parameters. The database can import and export from music21. It is built in Python
using the Neo4j network graph database.

A separate musicNetServer module is included which provides a RESTful web interface to
the musicNet objects.
