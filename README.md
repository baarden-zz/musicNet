musicNet
========

A music21 Python module that provides a network graph solution for multi-dimensional searches of music notation.

Please see [the main musicNet website](http://baarden.github.com/musicNet/) for more details.

musicNet is a system for conducting complex searches of symbolic polyphonic music databases. 
Searches are constructed by buildings networks of relationships and can be multidimensional, 
searching for patterns in multiple voices and other musical parameters.
The database can import and export from music21. 
In the current version searches are constructed using Python scripts.
